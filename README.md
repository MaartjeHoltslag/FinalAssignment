# FinalAssignment

For the Geo Scripting course of Wageningen University, we developed a programm to detect trees in urban areas.
We used the Open California data of Planet Labs as input data.
For the tree detection we used two different methods:
- Simple Classification
- Object Based Classification

For both methods we used several tools from the Orfeo ToolBox.

The Simple Classification method can be run from the script in MainTreeClassification.py. 
The Object Based Classification method can be run from the script in MainObjectBasedClassification.py.
Before running the script the data in the TrainPolygon map should be added to the right folder.
